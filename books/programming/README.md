As someone who has been involved in programming for many years, I know how important it is to have a solid foundation and to keep learning. With that in mind, I've put together a list of programming books that I believe can help anyone looking to improve their skills and knowledge. 

Whether you're just starting out or have been programming for a while, these books can help you broaden your horizons and deepen your understanding. I wish you all the best in your programming journey!
